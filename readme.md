# Advanced Python Calculator IS601

## Project Overview

My midterm project is to build a calculator program that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. This calculator project will feature environment variables, history storage, plugin integration, and operational logging for debugging and auditing. User interaction will be through a command-line interface (REPL), while Pandas manage the calculatorâ€™s history and work through python virtual environments. Lastly, the program would be tested using pytest, pylint, and coverage.
